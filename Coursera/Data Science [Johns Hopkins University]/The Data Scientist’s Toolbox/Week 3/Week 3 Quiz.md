# The Data Scientist's Toolbox (JHU) Quiz 3
#### *Here is a complete collection of all the answers.

Question 1
----------
We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. We observe that there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether they have lung cancer. We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population. We explain we think that the reason for this relationship is because cigarette smoke contains known carcinogens such as arsenic and benzene, which make cells in the lungs become cancerous.

- [x] This is an example of an inferential data analysis.
- [ ] This is an example of a predictive data analysis.

- [x] There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.
- [ ] We would be data dredging because we collected data on thousands of places in the United States.
- [ ] We would be performing inference on the relationship between Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.
- [ ] We wouldn't know the sensitivity of our predictions.
- [ ] We wouldn't be able to estimate the variability in Martha Stewart Living Subscribers.
- [ ] We wouldn't be able to calculate descriptive statistics on Our Site's Users.
- [ ] We couldn't be sure whether subscribing to Martha Steward Living causes people to be Users of Our Site or the other way around.

Question 4
----------
What is an experimental design tool that can be used to address variables that may be confounders at the design phase of an experiment?

- [x] Fixing variables.
- [x] Stratifying variables.
- [ ] Using all the data you have access too.
- [ ] Data cleaning.
- [ ] Using data from a database.
- [ ] Using regression models.
- [ ] Only using non-confounding variables.
- [ ] Taking a convenience sample.

Question 5
----------
What is the reason behind the explosion of interest in big data?

- [x] The price and difficulty of collecting and storing data has dramatically dropped.
- [ ] There have been massive improvements in statistical analysis techniques.
- [ ] There have been massive improvements in machine learning algorithms.
- [ ] Technologies like Hadoop and Map Reduce started the big data era.
